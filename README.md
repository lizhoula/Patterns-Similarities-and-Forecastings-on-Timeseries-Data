# Patterns-Similarities-and-Forecastings-on-Timeseries-Data
This project would look into the patterns, similarities and forecastings on the timeseris data and we will use Covid 19 data as our dataset.

Here we will discover the trend, seasonal and residual patterns of a time series data, visualize this patterns to our obeservations.

We will also do some smoothings like WMA, EMA etc.

Then, we will calculate the similarities among different time series data using euclidean distance or cosine similarity.

We will also use dynamic programming to discover the pairwise DTW cost in time series data.

Obtaining the staionarity of time series data helps us to have a more reasonable forecasting. Thus we will use differencing to achieve our goal.

We will use log return or simply ultilize ARIMA modeul in stats model.

We will also visualize the (partial)autocorrelation funtion.

To explore the forecasting accuracy by impact of adjacent variables, the VAR will also be introduced.
